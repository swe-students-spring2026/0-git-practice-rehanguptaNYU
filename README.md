[AI writing professional code in 2026?] https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what

I like this article because it confronts software engineers with the uncomfortable reality of how AI is changing the profession. 
Using AI you can quickly turn small ideas into functional projects with a few prompts to a decent level of accuracy. 
Skills that previously needed years of experience and tutorials can now just be done by AI. 
At the same time, it talks about how AI can weaken software engineering fundamentals in the future but can also make existing software engineering professionals more efficient, although some "traditional" software engineers have reported feeling demotivated at this rapid technological evolution.
As AI models become more advanced, the results from prompts are becoming better and better and within the last few years AI has gone from giving poor, rudimentary responses to doing professional tasks systematically. Infact, Anthropic's CEO said soon AI will write 90% of code.
